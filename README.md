# Reactive Application implemented by me

Personally, I am very impressed with the ideas behind Reactive Manifesto. (https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)
If you are as excited as I am but do not know where to start I strongly recommend Reactive Programming in Kotlin by Rivu Chakraborty.

More goals will be added.

Goal
1. To practice examples in Reactive Programming in Kotlin Book by Rivu Chakraborty (https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/reactive-programming-kotlin)
2. Extend the reactive application to my trading bot
